# Extract_Form_Fields
This project is based upon my recent project task. Automatically Extracting the form fields in json_format for html/aspx files after selecting the folder, which consists of bulk files. Here, I've developed the frontend application using reactjs and backend using nodejs to handle the file system.

End user has to select the particular folder, having number of different files like html, css, js, aspx, etc. This script only pass html / aspx files and extarct the form fields like tagName, textContent and attributes(like class, id, style, required, etc). Once the end user select the folder.

The json output file is available in json_output folder.

## If you want to run the code by cloning the repository in your local machine, you have to install the dependency npm packages. So, run the below command.
## npm i
## npm i -g concurrently

### Available Scripts

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.

It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.
